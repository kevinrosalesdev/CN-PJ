# Impact of Strategies against Hacker Attacks based on custom SIR and SIS Models

This last work of Complex Networks represents the convergence of all the knowledge and techniques learned in lectures and last 4 practices. The object of study is the propagation of malicious infected packets throughout computer networks and its possible countermeasures and defense strategies. Different architectures with different characteristics have been considered to conduct the necessary simulations and experiments to study the behavior of the propagation. Regarding the SIS model, to increase the resemblance with typical real computer networks, spontaneous infections were introduced to simulate the misuse (or negligence) from the user part, or a bug in routers or hubs.
